YATS: Yet Another TypeScript Syntax
===================================
![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HerringtonDarkholme/yats.vim/master/screenshot.png)

Yet Another TypeScript Syntax file for Vim, adapted from [YAJS](https://github.com/othree/yajs.vim).
Key differences:

* Exuberant Highlighting. The most elaborate or byzatine syntax highlighting for TypeScript.
* Use 'typescript' as group name's prefix, not 'typeScript' nor 'TypeScript'. Works great with [SyntaxComplete](https://github.com/vim-scripts/SyntaxComplete).
* Inherit Web API and DOM keywords from YAJS
* Remove old, unused syntax definitions.
